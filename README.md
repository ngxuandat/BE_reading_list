# Behavioral Economics reading list


Because there are not many textbooks on the subject, as a rule of thump, papers and other texts are the go-to. 
Here is a list of literature on the subject which I found to be particularly helpful. Pull requests are welcome!!

# 1. Behavioral Economics history and Basics.
## 1.1 Introduction
[1] Thaler, Richard H., Behavioral Economics: Past, Present and Future (May 27, 2016). [[pdf]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2790606) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Extra: Thaler himself gave a lecture with the same title. The record is also available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1M9VSgsSW4&t=270s).
